🚀 Automating Firewall Rule Updates with Python 🛡️

🔥 Project Overview:
In this project, I developed a Python script to automate the process of updating firewall rules based on data from a CSV file. By integrating XML parsing and CSV manipulation, this script efficiently updates firewall rule IP addresses in VMware Cloud Director.

⚙️ Tech Stack:

Python 🐍
xmltodict for parsing XML files 📄
Pandas for handling CSV files 📊
VMware Cloud Director for firewall rule management ☁️
🔑 Key Features:

Automatically loads and parses an XML file containing existing firewall rules.
Reads updates from a CSV file with source and destination IP changes.
Updates the firewall rules based on matching id or name and exports the modified rules to a new XML file.
Ensures easy maintenance and scalability for future changes 🔧.
🎯 Outcome:
This project simplifies the otherwise time-consuming process of manually updating firewall rules. With the power of Python, this solution saves both time and effort, reducing the chances of human errors during manual updates.
